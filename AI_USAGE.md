# 🤖 AI Usage Documentation

---

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the development and deployment of the Pokedex Favorites application. The primary goal of using AI was to assist with debugging deployment errors, configuring cloud infrastructure (Supabase & Vercel), and resolving database schema discrepancies.

**AI Tool Used:** Google Gemini (Large Language Model)

## 2. Areas of AI Implementation

AI assistance was utilized in the following specific areas:

### A. Deployment Configuration (Vercel)
* **Problem:** The Frontend (Vite) and Backend (Express) were in a monorepo, causing 404 errors when communicating between client and server on Vercel.
* **AI Solution:** Generated the `vercel.json` configuration file to handle **Rewrites/Proxy**. This allowed the frontend (`/api/...`) to correctly communicate with the backend server.
* **Prompt Example:** *"How to deploy a React frontend and Express backend in the same repo to Vercel? How to fix CORS/404 errors?"*

### B. Database Migration & Management (Supabase)
* **Problem:** Uploading a local PostgreSQL backup (`.sql`) to Supabase Cloud failed due to syntax errors (`\restrict`, `COPY FROM stdin`) generated by pgAdmin.
* **AI Solution:**
    1.  Identified that cloud SQL editors require "Plain SQL" format without proprietary commands.
    2.  Provided clean SQL scripts to manually create the `votes` table with the correct schema (`visitor_id` column).
* **Prompt Example:** *"My supabase sql editor shows syntax error at \restrict when restoring backup. How to fix?"*

### C. Backend Debugging (Node.js/Express)
* **Problem:** The application crashed with "Error 500" and "Self-signed certificate" errors upon deployment.
* **AI Solution:** Suggested adding the `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` configuration to the PostgreSQL connection pool to satisfy Supabase's SSL requirements.
* **Prompt Example:** *"Vercel logs show error: self signed certificate. How to fix pg connection?"*

### D. Code Refactoring
* **Problem:** The voting feature caused the app to crash (White Screen) on the production link.
* **AI Solution:** Identified that the Axios requests were hardcoded to `localhost:3000`. Refactored the code to use relative paths (`/api/pokemon`) to work dynamically in both local and production environments.

## 3. Human Verification & Synthesis

While AI provided code snippets and configuration advice, all implementations were verified and integrated manually by the developer:

1.  **Logic Verification:** I manually tested the voting logic to ensure the `visitor_id` (IP-based) prevention worked as intended.
2.  **Code Integration:** AI suggestions (like `vercel.json`) were adapted to fit the specific folder structure (`client` vs `server`) of this repository.
3.  **Debugging:** I actively monitored Vercel Logs and Browser Console to validate that the AI-suggested fixes resolved the specific error codes (404, 500).

## 4. Conclusion
The core business logic, frontend design, and project structure were designed by the developer. AI was used primarily as a **DevOps Assistant** to overcome specific deployment hurdles and environment configuration issues.
